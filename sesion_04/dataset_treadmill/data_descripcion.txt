Example 8.2—Treadmill Walking Distance in Intermittent Claudication
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the new drug Novafylline,
thought to reduce the symptoms of intermittent claudication, or a placebo in a
4-month double-blind study. The primary measurement of efficacy is the
walking distance on a treadmill until discontinuation due to claudication
pain. A total of 38 patients underwent treadmill testing at baseline (Month-0)
and at each of 4 monthly, follow-up visits. The treadmill walking distances (in
meters) are shown in Table 8.6. Patients were stratified by sex. Is there any
distinction in exercise tolerance profiles between patients who receive
Novafylline and those on placebo?
